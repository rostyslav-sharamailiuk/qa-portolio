# UX Notes – PrestaShop Demo

## Login/Registration
- If either of login/password fields is not filled, appropriate notification is shown
- Forgot password link - easily findable and clickable
- If password is not correct - field is erased and appropriate notification is shown
- Understandable "Create an account" form
- Issue: "Login" button is always active, even if user doesn't enter login and password

## Product Catalog / Search
- Search bar: clearly visible, autocomplete suggestions work 
- Filters: category and price filters are easy to apply 
- Sorting: sorting by price and popularity is intuitive 
- No results message: displays "No products found" when nothing matches
- Issue: "Home" category is inaccessible from main page, only accessible when user chooses subcategory (clothes/accessories/art)
- Issue: When choosing a brend in "Brands" section, filters are unavailable
- Issue: When using one filter, filters that are not available dissapear, instead of becoming unclickable, which may confuse the user

## Cart / Checkout
- Add to cart button: prominent and clickable 
- Cart page: quantity can be easily edited, products can be removed 
- Checkout steps: steps are clearly separated, progress bar is visible 
- Place order button: visible and active after filling required fields
- Issue: Cart updates are not instant on some actions, user might think action failed

  
## General / Usability
- Mobile view: buttons and menus are responsive and usable 
- Navigation: main menu is intuitive, easy to return to home 
- Consistency: button styles, fonts, and colors consistent across site 
- Feedback: users receive notifications after actions (add to cart, login)
- Issue: User is logged out after manual page refresh
- Issue: Some product pages lack recommended products; users must manually navigate back to continue shopping
- Issue: 'Filter' button in Brand subcategory opens empty window that cannot be closed
